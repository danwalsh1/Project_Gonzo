Inside activity_main.xml change line 7 where it says "jacob" (it could say "salazhar" but the same applies) to the name of your user.
Inside MainActivity.java change line 1 whee it says "jacob" (it could say "salazhar" but the same applies) to the name of your user.
You do not need to change anything inside build.gradle.
