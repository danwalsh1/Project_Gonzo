The files in this folder have content that should be replaced inside a newly made project.

--

The content in -main_activity.txt- should replace the content in -main_activity.xml-

The content in -MainActivity.txt- should replace the content in -MainActivity.java-

The content inside -buildgradle.txt- should replace the content in the -build.gradle- file located at the path -"ProjectGonzo/build.gradle"-.
Make sure this is the "build.gradle" with "Project:ProjectGonzo" to the right of it as there are 2 of the same name here.

Inside activity_main.xml change line 7 where it says "jacob" (it could say "salazhar" but the same applies) to the name of your user.
Inside MainActivity.java change line 1 whee it says "jacob" (it could say "salazhar" but the same applies) to the name of your user.
You do not need to change anything inside build.gradle.
